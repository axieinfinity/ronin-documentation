## Overview

This page demonstrates how to increase you withdraw your stake from your current validator, or move it to another validator.

## Prerequisites

Stake your RON tokens to a validator by following the steps in the [Stake RON](./../onboarding/become-delegator.mdx) guide.

## Increase your stake with a validator

After staking your RON tokens to a validator, you can increase your stake with this validator to earn higher rewards.

1. Go to the [RON staking](https://app.roninchain.com/staking) page and select
the **My staking** tab.

1. Find the validator with whom you want to increase the stake,
click the three docs expand the options, and then select **Delegate**.

1. Enter the amount manually or choose **Max** to stake all your
available RON, and then select **Delegate** once more. The estimated rewards are
calculated based on your APR (annual percentage rate),
so you can see how much RON will return from this stake.
