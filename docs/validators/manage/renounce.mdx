# Renounce your role
You can renounce your role as a validator. 
If you're a Standard Validator or Validator Candidate, 
follow this guide. If you’re a Governing Validator, contact 
the Sky Mavis team for renunciation.

1. Go to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com) >
**My Staking** > expand the options > **Renounce**.

2. Confirm your decision. Keep in mind that renunciation
is permanent and cannot be undone.

3. Click **Renounce** to submit the request.

:::caution
After sumbitting the request, you need to wait seven days for
renunciation to take effect. To avoid slashing, keep your node
online and up to date during this period.
:::

Your commission, bridge rewards, staking rewards, and the remaining
self-stake will be transferred to you on the date of renunciation.
