## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to add a *finality vote key* to your profile. The finality vote key is used to vote for blocks in the [fast finality mechanism](https://github.com/axieinfinity/REPs/blob/main/REP-0003.md#rewards). If you're an active Ronin validator, you need to have this key added in order to have the Fast Finality Reward transferred to your admin address by the end of the day.

## Prerequisites

### Generate a BLS key pair

Before you add a finality vote key, you need to generate a BLS key pair. The BLS key pair consists of a private key and a public key. The public BLS key is your finality vote key. For more information, see the [Generate BLS key pair](./../setup/generate-keys.md) guide.

### Generate proof of possession

To prove that you own the finality vote key, you need to generate a proof of possession. The proof of possession is a signature of the public key using the private key.
There are two ways to generate the proof of posession: using the Ronin CLI or using the Docker image.

#### Generate using Ronin CLI

1. Ensure you have the encrypted BLS private key and password in your current directory:
   ```bash
   > tree
   .
   ├── bls_keystore
   │   └── all-accounts.keystore.json
   └── bls_password
   ```

2. Run the following command to generate the proof of possession: 
   ```bash
   ronin account generate-bls-proof
   ```

The command will return the BLS public key and the corresponding proof:
```bash
BLS public key #0: {redacted}
BLS proof #0: {redacted}
```

#### Generate using Docker image

1. In the `.env` file of your node's Docker image, add the following line:
   ```text
   GENERATE_BLS_PROOF=true
   ```

2. Run the following command to start the node:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Run the following command to view the logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs node
   ```
   
The logs will return the BLS public key and the corresponding proof:

```bash
BLS public key #0: {redacted}
BLS proof #0: {redacted}
```

## Add a finality vote key {#add}

1. Open the [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com), then go to your account, and then click **My profile**.
   <img src={profile} width={280} />

2. In the **Finality Vote Key** field, click **Add key**.
   <img src={addStepOne} width={400} />

3. Paste your BLS public key and the proof of posession.
   <img src={addStepTwo} width={400} />

4. Save the changes.

## Change your finality vote key {#change}

1. Open the Validator Dashboard, then go to your account, and then click **My profile**.
   <img src={profile} width={280} />

2. In the **Finality Vote Key** field, click the edit icon.
   <img src={editStepOne} width={400} />

3. Paste your new BLS public key and the proof of posession.
   <img src={editStepTwo} width={400} />

4. Save the changes.

There's a cooldown period of 24 hours after changing the finality vote key. That means you will not able to modify the finality vote key again until 24 hours after the last change.
