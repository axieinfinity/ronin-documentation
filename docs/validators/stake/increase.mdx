# Increase stake

After becoming a validator, you can increase your self-staked amount of RON.

1. Go to the [staking dashboard](https://saigon-staking.roninchain.com/) and select **My Staking**.
2. Click **Stake more**.

3. Enter the amount and click **Stake**. The estimated reward is calculated based on your estimated APR (annual percentage rate), so you can see how much RON will return from this stake.

After the transaction is confirmed, you can review its details
on the **Activities** tab or check the status in [Ronin Block Explorer](https://saigon-explorer.roninchain.com/).
