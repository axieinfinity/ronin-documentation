# Bailout

## Overview

If you're in [tier 2 validator slashing](./slashing.mdx), you can _bail out_ of jail at any time using your credit score.

The credit score is calculated as follows:
* All validators start with a 0 credit score.
* Every day, each validator (who is not in jail) is given 50 credits if they miss no block. The validator loses 1 credit for every missed block. 
* The maximum number of credits for a validator is 1,800.

## Check your credit score

Go to the **My Staking** page and find your current credit score under **CREDIT SCORE**, next to your total self-stake amount.

## Use credit score to bail out

It takes 5 credits to bail out for each epoch.

1. On **My Staking**, find the warning banner, and then click **Bail out**. If the button is inactive, it means that your current credit score is less than 5.

2. Review the conditions and click **Confirm**.

If you bail out on the same day you got slashed, you still receive 50% of the block reward (commission and staking) from the time you bailed out until the end of the day.
