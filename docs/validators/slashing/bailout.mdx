# Bailout

## Overview

If you're in [tier 2 validator slashing](slashing.mdx), you can bail out
of jail at any time using your credit score.
  
The credit score is calculated as follows:
* All validators start with a 0 credit score.
* Every day, each validator (who is not in jail) is given 50 credits 
if they miss no block. The validator loses 1 credit for every missed block.
* The maximum number of credits for a validator is 1,800.
* It takes 2 credits to bail out for each epoch.

## Check your credit score

1. Go to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com/) >
**My Staking**.
2. Find your credit score under **CREDIT SCORE**, next to your total
self-stake amount.

## Use credit score to bail out
It takes 5 credits to bail out for each epoch.

1. Go to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com/) >
**My Staking**.

2. Locate the warning banner and select **Bail out**.

If you bail out on the same day you got slashed, you still receive 50%
of the block reward (commission and staking) from the time you bailed
out until the end of the day.
