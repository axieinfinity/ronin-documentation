## Overview

Slashing is a mechanism that governs the behavior of validators on
the Ronin blockchain.

Each validator is required to keep the node
online and up to date with the network, and to produce the correct
block when it comes to their turn.

If a node is unavailable when needed or shows signs of malicious
behavior, it is subjected to penalties such as the the following:
* Reward slashing. Withholding rewards that the node would've 
otherwise earned.
* RON slashing. Charging a fixed amount of RON tokens from 
the self-stake. Slashed RON then go to back to the reward pool.
* Temporary or permanent ban from the network, or _jailing_.

:::note 
A "day" in the slashing rules refers to the period
from midnight to midnight UTC.

## Double-sign validator

It's a serious violation when a validator signs more than one block with the same height.
Anyone can submit a slash request with the double-sign evidence, which
should contain the two block headers with the same height, sealed by
the same validator. Upon verifying the evidence, the offending
validator is penalized as follows:

* The validator is jailed for $2^{63}-1$ blocks and can't be a
validator in the future.
* The validator is slashed the minimum staking amount of
self-delegated RON.
* The validator doesn't earn commission and the staking reward while in jail.

The validator's status is set to **In jail**.

## Unavailability validator

The performance of Ronin relies on the ability of everyone in the
validator set to produce blocks on time when it's their turn.
If a validator misses their turn, it affects the performance of
the entire system. Thus, we implemented a mechanism that penalizes
validators who miss too many blocks.

We use a smart contract to record the number of missed blocks for each
validator. If the number of missed blocks exceeds a predefined threshold,
the validator gets slashed.

### Tier 1 validator slashing

If a validator misses more than 100 blocks in a day, the validator doesn't earn
commission and the staking reward on that day.
The validator's status is set to **Punished**.

### Tier 2 validator slashing

If a validator misses more than 500 blocks in a day, the following penalties apply:
* The validator doesn't earn commission and the staking reward on that day.
* The validator is slashed 1,000 of self-delegated RON.
* The validator is jailed for $\approx$ 2 days (57,600 blocks) and is
banned from the validator set while in jail.

The validator's status is set to **In Jail**. If the validator
has sufficient credit score, they can [bail out](bailout.mdx) of jail.

### Tier 3 validator slashing

After getting bailed out, if the validator
misses 100 more blocks on the same day, the following penalties apply:
* The reward after bailout is removed.
* The validator is slashed 1,000 of self-delegated RON.
* The validator is jailed for $\approx$ 2 days (57,600 blocks).

The validator's status is set to **In Jail**, and this time,
the validator can't bail out.

## Fast finality slashing

In the [fast finality mechanism](https://github.com/axieinfinity/REPs/blob/main/REP-0003.md#rep-0003-optimistic-fast-finality),
it's a serious violation when a validator publishes two distinct votes
for the same height. The evidence can be submitted by anyone who notices
the malicious behavior. Upon verifying the evidence, the offending
validator is penalized as follows:

* The validator is jailed for $2^{63}-1$ blocks and can't be a
validator in the future.
* The validator is slashed for 250,000 of
self-delegated RON.

The validator's status is set to **In Jail**.

## Relaying slash

If a Governing Validator doesn’t sync the set of bridge
operators to the Ethereum chain for three consecutive days,
the following penalties apply:

* The validator is slashed 10,000 of self-delegated RON.
* The validator doesn't earn commission on the day of slashing.

The validator's status is set to **Punished**.

## Multiple slashes

Validators might experience multiple concurrent slashes if they have issues
with both their validator node and bridge operator node, and the relaying
responsibilities of the Governing Validator.
