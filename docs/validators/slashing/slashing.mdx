# Slashing

## Overview
_Slashing_ is a mechanism that governs the behavior of validators on the Ronin blockchain.

Each validator is responsible for running two nodes: a validator node and a bridge operator node. Validators are required to keep the nodes online and up to date with the network, and to produce the correct block when it comes to their turn.

If a validator is unavailable when needed or shows signs of malicious behavior, they get penalized by having their stake or reward reduced, or _slashed_, as follows:
* Reward slashing. Withholding rewards that the validator would've otherwise received.
* RON slashing. Charging a fixed amount of RON tokens from the validator's self-stake.

In addition, the validator may be temporarily or permanently banned from the network, or _jailed_.

## Slashable behavior

There are four types of slashable behavior on the Ronin blockchain, where the penalties described apply in combination. 

### Double-sign validator

The case in which a validator signs more than one block with the same height. Their status will be set to **In jail**. They will be slashed the minimum staking amount from their self-stake, put in jail for 2^63-1 blocks and won’t receive commission or staking rewards during this time. They are not allowed to be a validator in the future.

### Unavailability validator

The case in which a validator misses a certain number of blocks a day. There are three tiers in this slash.

#### Tier 1

The validator missed their turn to produce blocks more than 50 times a day. Their status will be set to **Punished** and they won’t receive commission or staking rewards during this time.

#### Tier 2

The validator missed their turn to produce blocks more than 150 times a day. Their status will be set to **In jail**. They will be slashed 10,000 RON, put in jail for ~2 days and won’t receive commission or staking rewards during this time. In this tier, the validator can bail out if they have enough credit score.

#### Tier 3

The validator bailed out of Tier 2 successfully, but missed their turn to produce blocks more than 50 times on the same day. Their status will be set to **In jail**. They will be slashed 10,000 RON, put in jail for ~2 days and won’t receive commission or staking rewards during this time. This time the validator can’t bail out.

### Unavailability bridge operator

The case in which a validator (their bridge operator node) missed a certain number of votes. There are two tiers in this slash.

#### Tier 1

The validator missed more than 10% votes. Their status will be set to **Punished** and they won’t receive bridge rewards during this time.

<img src={bridSlashTierOne} width={1224} />

#### Tier 2

The validator missed more than 20% votes. Their status will be set to **In jail**. They will be put in jail for ~2 days and won’t receive any rewards (commission or staking rewards or bridge reward) during this time. In this tier, the validator can’t bail out.

### Relaying slash

The case when a Governing Validator doesn’t sync the set of bridge operators to the Ethereum chain for three consecutive days. Their status will be set to **Punished**. They will be slashed 10,000 RON and won’t receive commission during this time.

### Multiple slashes

Validators might experience multiple concurrent slashes if they have issues with both their validator node, bridge operator node, and the relaying responsibilities of the Governing Validator.
