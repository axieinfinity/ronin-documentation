* **Admin address.** The address to manage your profile, staking activities, and claiming rewards.
* **Validator address.** The address used for minting blocks. This address is displayed to delegators and also called “consensus address”.

If you’re a Governing Validator, your profile has an additional two addresses:
* **Chain governor address.** The address used to create proposals and vote for changes.
