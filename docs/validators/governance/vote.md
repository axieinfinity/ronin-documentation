# Vote on a proposal
As a Governing Validator, you can vote on proposals created by other Governing Validators.

## Voting ratio
* Proposals that are approved by more than or equal to 80% of Governing Validators will be executed.
* Proposals that are rejected by more than or equal to 20% of Governing Validators will be rejected and closed.
* Proposals that are neither approved nor rejected within 14 days will expire and be closed automatically.

## Cast your vote
1. Log in to the [validator portal](https://saigon-staking.roninchain.com) using your Chain Governor address—the identifier of a Governing Validator. If you see your role at the top right corner, then you used the correct address.
