## Ronin Safe

Ronin Safe is a multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet built around Gnosis Safe. A multi-sig wallet requires multiple keys to sign a transaction before it can be executed. For example, you can set up multiple devices, such as hardware wallets, EOA-based wallets, paper wallets, or a combination of them, to confirm transactions.
