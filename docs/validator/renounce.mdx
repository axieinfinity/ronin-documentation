# Renounce your role
You can request renunciation of your role as a validator. If you're a Standard Validator or Validator Candidate, follow this guide. If you’re a Governing Validator, contact the Sky Mavis team for renunciation.

1. Go to the [staking dashboard](https://saigon-staking.roninchain.com/) and select **My Staking**.
2. Expand the options and click **Renounce**.

2. Read through the explanation and confirm your decision. Keep in mind that you won’t be able to cancel or undo this action.

3. Click **Renounce** to submit the request.

After submission, you will need to wait for seven days for renunciation to take effect. All the commission, bridge rewards, staking rewards and the remaining self-stake will be transferred to you automatically on the date of renunciation.

:::caution
Because your role remains active during the seven-day waiting period, you're advised to keep your node online and up to date with the network to avoid slashing.
