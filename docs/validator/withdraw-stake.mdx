# Withdraw your stake
You can withdraw part of your stake back to your wallet as long as it’s been three days since you last staked in. The remaining balance after withdrawal has to be at least 500,000 RON (subject to change on mainnet).

:::caution
Withdrawing a stake might lower your chance of being selected as a validator in the upcoming days, depending on how much others have staked.
