title: Bridge governance
---

The bridge's governance process is conducted via a decentralized voting
mechanism. Each bridge operator a corresponding bridge governor
address that is used for proposing and voting.

Bridge operators can propose and vote on the following types of changes:

* Pause the bridge
* Add bridge operators
* Remove bridge operators
* Update withdrawal thresholds

A bridge operator creates a new proposal
for the other operators to vote on. If at least 70% of the
operators approve the proposal, the change is approved and executed.

The governance voting method is serial by design: only one governance
vote can be held at a time, and that vote must be completed before moving
to a new vote.

Conceptually, you can think of the governor as a cold wallet while the
validator is a hot wallet.

:::caution
For enhanced security, store your governor credentials in a hardware wallet and use them only
when a vote is required.
