## Overview

This guide describes how to use Ronin Bridge to send an ERC20 token from an Ethereum wallet to your Ronin Wallet. For information on supported Ethereum wallets and ERC20 tokens, see [Ronin Bridge](../overview.md).

## Prerequisites

If you access Ronin Bridge through the Ronin Wallet mobile app, then you can only connect Ethereum wallets imported into your Ronin Wallet beforehand. For more information, see [Importing Your MetaMask Wallet to Ronin Wallet](https://support.roninchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/14862812718107-Importing-Your-MetaMask-Wallet-to-Ronin-Wallet).

## Step 1. Fill in the details

1. Open the [Ronin Bridge](https://app.roninchain.com/bridge) app and select the **Deposit** tab.
2. In the **From** field, connect the Ethereum wallet that you want to transfer the token from. In the mobile Ronin Wallet app, select your imported Ethereum wallet.

3. In the **To** field, enter the Ronin address or RNS name that you want to deposit the token into. **Note:** To transfer to an RNS name, you need to enter the full domain name, such as "example.ron."

Choose the ERC20 token that you want to deposit, then enter the amount manually or select **Max** to transfer the entire balance of this token available in your connected wallet.

## Step 3. Confirm the deposit

1. Review the transaction details, including the gas fees associated with the deposit. Make sure you have enough ETH in your Ethereum wallet to cover the fees. If everything looks correct, select **Deposit**.

2. When prompted, sign the transaction in your connected wallet.
3. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed by the network. Be patient, however, as transactions can take some time to complete, depending on network congestion and gas fees.
